Georges St-Pierre's UFC return was a tale of two tales.

In one corner, the welterweight GOAT's return to action after four years away was a fascinating story. One of the greatest fighters of all time presented a terrific fighting mystery as he battled ring rust and a move (for the first time) up to the 185-pound middleweight division.

In the other, you had a former star making a tepid grab for relevance, a man whose once-lustrous name no longer held water on today's MMA landscape, who was hopelessly outsized and outmatched given the circumstances.

The bets were settled at UFC 217, when the French-Canadian fightbot took on hot-headed Brit Michael Bisping for Bisping's middleweight title.

That was the big-name bout on the marquee, but it may not have been the best fight. There were two, count them, other title fights on the card. In the co-main event, Cody Garbrandt put his title on the line against TJ Dillashaw. These are two very, very elite fighters who really, really dislike each other. 

In the other, strawweight kingpin Joanna Jedrzejczyk defended her belt against Rose Namajunas. This matchup also grew heated as fight night approached, with the champ running all sorts of psyops against an outwardly impassive challenger.

From Fight Pass to finale, all of UFC 217 was worth the time investment. Madison Square Garden and New York City tends to bring out that kind of card density. As always, though, the final stat lines only reveal so much. These are the real winners and losers from Manhattan.

For the literal-minded among us, full card results appear at the end.
